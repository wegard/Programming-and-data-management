<h1>Programming and data management</h1>
<p>
    This is a course designed to provide students with foundational knowledge in programming using Python and a solid understanding of data management principles. 
    The course is divided into four main sections. Initially, it focuses on basic Python programming, covering topics like variables, expressions, statements, built-in functions, and the Python Standard Library. 
    It then progresses to working with third-party libraries, introducing students to linear algebra using Numpy, data analysis with Pandas, and visualization techniques with Matplotlib. 
    Advanced topics, such as Generative AI for programming and probability-based data analysis, are also explored. 
    The final segment of the course delves into databases, emphasizing the integration of SQL with Python.
